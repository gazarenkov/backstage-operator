# backstage-install-operator
Operator for deploying Backstage



## Description
Implementing https://backstage.io/docs/deployment/k8s/ procedure
At first stage CR update does not affect Backstage Objects, just installation (same as Helm)
TODO: Do we need to continuosly sync the states? Which way if so: from CR to Objects or back or (somehow) back and forth?

Make sure namespace is created.

Local Database (PostgreSQL) is created by default, to disable
spec: 
  skipLocalDb: true
This way third party DB can teorethically be configured. TODO: It just requires some changes in Backstage appConfig (I think), 
because it only expects either in-container SQLite or MySQL.
TODO: should we consider using in-container SQLite for K8s deployment as well (single container deployment)?

TODO: POSTGRES_HOST = <name-of the service> , POSTGRES_PORT = <port>[5432] can be delivered to the Backstage 
Deployment out of Postgres Secret? Indeed, it is not really a secret.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/backstage-deploy-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/backstage-deploy-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
